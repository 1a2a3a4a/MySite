Wraps a single child without adding\n\tadditional DOM nodes.\n\t\n\tThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\n\tanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\n\tto the child on the next tick.\n\t\n\tBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\n\tcommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\n\tback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\n\tthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\n\treturn to after animating away.\n\t\n\tProperties:\n\t animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n\t   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n\t runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n\t targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n\t   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n\t   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n\t   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n\t   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n\t   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n\t interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the \"animation\" prop is\n\t   changed before it’s done. Default is \"stop\", which halts the animation where it is. \"finish\"\n\t   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. \"queue\" will run the new animation after\n\t   the previous one has finished.\n\t\n\tUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\t\n\tMethods:\n\t runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n\t   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n\t   occurs).\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar _ = {\n\t  forEach: __webpack_require__(121),\n\t  isEqual: __webpack_require__(187),\n\t  keys: __webpack_require__(37),\n\t  omit: __webpack_require__(188)\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar React = __webpack_require__(3);\n\tvar ReactDOM = __webpack_require__(33);\n\tvar PropTypes = __webpack_require__(7);\n\tvar Velocity = __webpack_require__(120);\n\t\n\tvar VelocityComponent = function (_React$Component) {\n\t  _inherits(VelocityComponent, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t  function VelocityComponent(props) {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, VelocityComponent);\n\t\n\t    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (VelocityComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(VelocityComponent)).call(this, props));\n\t\n\t    _this._animationTimeout = null;\n\t\n\t    // This public method is kept as self-bound to maintain compatibility with the React.createClass\n\t    // version of the component.\n\t    _this.runAnimation = _this.runAnimation.bind(_this);\n\t    return _this;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  _createClass(VelocityComponent, [{\n\t    key: 'componentDidMount',\n\t    value: function componentDidMount() {\n\t      this.runAnimation();\n\t\n\t      // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n\t      // been run to completion.\n\t      if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n\t        this._finishAnimation();\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t  }, {\n\t    key: 'componentWillUpdate',\n\t    value: function componentWillUpdate(newProps, newState) {\n\t      if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n\t        if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'stop') {\n\t          this._stopAnimation();\n\t        } else if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'finish') {\n\t          this._finishAnimation();\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        this._scheduleAnimation();\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t  }, {\n\t    key: 'componentWillUnmount',\n\t    value: function componentWillUnmount() {\n\t      this._stopAnimation();\n\t      this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n\t\n\t      if (this._animationTimeout) {\n\t        clearTimeout(this._animationTimeout);\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    // It's ok to call this externally!

Use this for non-animating properties (like \"position\") that\n\tare prerequisites for correct animation. The style value is applied using Velocity's JS -> CSS\n\troutines, which may differ from React's.\n\t\n\tAny hash entries beyond \"animation\" and \"style\" are passed in an options hash to Velocity. Use this\n\tfor options like \"stagger\", \"reverse\", &tc.\n\t\n\tBy default, this component will immediately hide all entering children with display: 'none', and\n\tunhide them one tick later with display: ''. This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\n\tinto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected. If\n\tyou prefer a different way of hiding these elements so that e.g. geometry can be immediately\n\tcalculated, use the enterHideStyle and enterShowStyle props to provide alternate style hashes for\n\thiding and revealing entering elements.\n\t\n\tStatics\n\t  disabledForTest: Set this to true globally to turn off all custom animation logic.

Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

Wraps a single child without adding\nadditional DOM nodes.\n\nThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\nanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\nto the child on the next tick.\n\nBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\ncommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\nback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\nthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\nreturn to after animating away.\n\nProperties:\n animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the \"animation\" prop is\n   changed before it’s done. Default is \"stop\", which halts the animation where it is. \"finish\"\n   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. \"queue\" will run the new animation after\n   the previous one has finished.\n\nUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\nMethods:\n runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n   occurs).\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit')\n};\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar PropTypes = require('prop-types');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\nvar VelocityComponent = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(VelocityComponent, _React$Component);\n\n  function VelocityComponent(props) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, VelocityComponent);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (VelocityComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(VelocityComponent)).call(this, props));\n\n    _this._animationTimeout = null;\n\n    // This public method is kept as self-bound to maintain compatibility with the React.createClass\n    // version of the component.\n    _this.runAnimation = _this.runAnimation.bind(_this);\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  _createClass(VelocityComponent, [{\n    key: 'componentDidMount',\n    value: function componentDidMount() {\n      this.runAnimation();\n\n      // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n      // been run to completion.\n      if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n        this._finishAnimation();\n      }\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'componentWillUpdate',\n    value: function componentWillUpdate(newProps, newState) {\n      if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n        if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'stop') {\n          this._stopAnimation();\n        } else if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'finish') {\n          this._finishAnimation();\n        }\n\n        this._scheduleAnimation();\n      }\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'componentWillUnmount',\n    value: function componentWillUnmount() {\n      this._stopAnimation();\n      this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n\n      if (this._animationTimeout) {\n        clearTimeout(this._animationTimeout);\n      }\n    }\n\n    // It's ok to call this externally!

This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\ninto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected.
